<p>This is an open community about science and technology of Informatin, Computing, Intelligence and Quantum. Alternatively, it is about the information science and technolgoy in the quantum era and quantum physics-based intelligence. We welcome all open discussions, projects and shares related to this field.  </p>

<p>Currently, we are fortunate to be in the frontier of QICI. We are mainly focusing on the following topics in this community: </p>

<ul class="clist">
<li>1) Collecting useful theories and frameworks from different disciplines which may be useful for QICI development; </li>

<li>2) Discussing basic concepts and roadmaps which may lead to a fruitful and bright future of QICI; </li>

<li>3) Carry on some open discussions and projects so that good ideas and skills can be developed for those who participate.  </li>

</ul>

<p>You are welcome to participate in these topics nominated above, make friends and benefit from participating. You are more than welcome to bring in your own topics that we haven't noticed yet significant for our QICI community. </p>
<p>Open discussions and news are frequetly nominated in the Google+ community. You can digest them at your time and free of pressure. You are always welcome to nominate your own questions at any time and frequency in this community.</p>

 <p>We are seeking nominations of proper open projects that our members can take part in or benefit from at current stage. This website will be mainly used for linking and organizing related open-source projects in this field.
