This is an open project aiming at facilitating collaborations and creativities in the field of quantum information, quantum computing and quantum artificial intelligence. It is expected to have a website linking with discussions, documentations and maybe some implements of algorithms. Here is the source code for the website and the repository for related projects.

Now, the project is at alpha-phase.

Welcome to fork and pull requests. Suggestions on building projects and websites for quantum information, quantum computing and quantum artificial intelligence are also highly appreciated.
