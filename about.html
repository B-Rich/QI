<p>This is an open community for Quantum Artificial Intelligence, which refers to AI in the quantum era or quantum physics-based intelligence. We welcome all open discussions, projects and shares related to this field. </p>

<p>Currently, we are fortunate to be in the frontier of QAI. We are mainly focusing on the following topics in this community: </p>

<ul class="clist">
<li>1) Collecting useful theories and frameworks from different disciplines which may be useful for QAI development; </li>

<li>2) Discussing basic concepts and roadmaps which may lead to a fruitful and bright future of QAI; </li>

<li>3) Carry on some open discussions and projects so that good ideas and skills can be developed for those who participate. </li>

</ul>

<p>You are welcome to participate in these topics nominated above, make friends and benefit from participating. You are more than welcome to bring in your own topics that we haven't noticed yet significant for our QAI community. Open discussion statements are usually voluntarily nominated on each Friday or Saturday, so that our members can think on them in the weekends free of pressure from jobs. You are always welcome to nominate your own questions at any time and frequency in this community.</p>

 <p>We are seeking nominations of proper open projects that our members can take part in at current stage. Contact present moderators if you would like to help moderate, or run a special topic section. Please bring more friends who are interested in this topic to join us :)
